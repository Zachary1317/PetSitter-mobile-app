## PetSitter-mobile-app
PetSitter is a mobile app that allows users to foster and adopt pets.

## Description
We formed a team of four and planned to complete the project within a month. I am responsible for the development of the front end for user registration and user information display. Now I have completed the design of the UI interface with Figma and the development of some pages with React native.
